<h2>Coaching, Refereeing, and Rules</h2>
<p>Some important considerations on refereeing from Jim Schmitz, former U.S. Olympic Team Weightlifting Coach.</p>
<blockquote>
"My belief is that all weightlifting coaches should become referees as well. Being a referee makes you a better coach...[it] can save a lifter a critical lift."
<br>
"If you give a lifter a bad lift you are taking away from the lifters who did it correctly...In fact, by turning down a lift, the lifter will get the message that he has to clean up and improve his technique."
<br>
"Experienced lifters...need to be judged as they would be at the national and international level."
</blockquote>
